      Review and ensure that:
        - Check for clean design and modularity to improve long-term scalability.
        - Identify synchronous operations that may block the event loop, affecting performance.
        - Limit simultaneous database connections to avoid overload, ideally using connection pools.
        - Ensure code clarity with descriptive naming and structure.
        - Verify that errors and exceptions are properly managed without exposing sensitive information.
        - Optimize database queries to enhance efficiency.
        - Detect security risks like SQL injections and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
        - Confirm adequate code coverage through automated tests.
        - Assess adherence to SOLID design principles to encourage a well-structured codebase.
